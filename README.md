# FRC Team 6695's Robot Code for 2019

We made it to Houston!!!

## Robot Info

Our robot uses 8" mechanum wheels and the West Coast Products Elevator for a lift. We used a super jank grabber that uses spinning stealth wheels and a frame to pinck up balls. A simple bent aliminum piece is used for picking up hatches. 

## Branch Stuff

Master will be kept up with the version of the code used at competition, but changes should not be made directly onto it. We have tried squared and linear inputs and our driver prefers linear, so that's what we're going with.
